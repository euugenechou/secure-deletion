=== Overview

=== Requirements

    1 - Linux kernel compiled with device-mapper support. If device-mapper is
    compiled as a module, it must be loaded.

    2 - This module has been built and tested with kernel version 4.7. It may or
    may not work with different kernel versions.

    3 - The ERASER userland tool to create and run ERASER instances.

=== Build and Install Instructions

    To build in-tree:

    1 - Copy the source file into "<source>/drivers/md/dm-eraser.c".

    2 - Insert the following line into "<source>/drivers/md/Makefile":

        obj-m += dm-eraser.o

    3 - Then follow the usual kernel compilation process.

    To build out-of-tree, simply follow the usual module compilation process.
    
=== Usage

    - Users should interact with the ERASER module only through the provided
      userland tool. Directly using the device-mapper ioctl interface, or the
      "dmsetup" command line tool may result in incorrect behavior and data
      loss.
