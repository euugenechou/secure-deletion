=== Overview

=== Requirements

    1 - Linux kernel compiled with device-mapper support. If device-mapper is
    compiled as a module, it must be loaded.

    2 - ERASER kernel module. Note that the ERASER module has been developed for
    and tested with Linux kernel version 4.7.

    3 - Device-mapper user space library and tools.

    4 - OpenSSL.

    5 - TrouSerS software stack and shared libraries.

=== Build and Install Instructions

    Run "make" to compile the program. The executable "eraser" can be found in the
    "./build" directory. Optionally, run "make install" to install the
    executable under "/usr/bin/".

=== Usage

    - Creating a new ERASER instance:

           eraser create <block-device> <tpm-nvram-index>
   e.g.    eraser create /dev/sdb1 5


    - Opening an ERASER instance:

           eraser open <block-device> <eraser-name>
   e.g.    eraser open /dev/sdb1 my-eraser-dev


    - Closing an ERASER instance:

           eraser close <eraser-name>
   e.g.    eraser close my-eraser-dev

    - Listing open ERASER instances:

           eraser list

    Notes:

    1 - Create, open and close operations require root privileges, run them with
    sudo.

    2 - The open command by default maps the virtual device to
    "/dev/mapper/eraser". You can specify a different name using the
    [--mapped-dev] option.

    3 - See "eraser --help" for a summary of available options.
